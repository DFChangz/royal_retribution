Notes:
  After running with both valgrind and sanitizers, there are many leaks that
  are coming directly from SDL. All dynamically allocated elements are freed
  all surfaces are freed before reassignment, all textures, audio, the rend-
  erer, and window are all destroyed whenever the application quits, and all
  SDL libraries have been quit when the application panics and when it clos-
  es successfully.
