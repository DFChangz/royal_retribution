FIXES
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Concerning Levels
- new music plays in-game
- instruction texts are now centered
- instruction texts are more event-specific
- panning does not have glitchy flying images
  * how to skip panning instructions were added
  * panning can now move in multiple directions

Concerning Character
- character cannot push around enemies
- character cannot run through enemies
- sword hitbox has become more accurate
- character actually "falls" down a hole
  ~ the hole does not remain in the level
- running no longer sneaks past enemies (you are louder when you run)

Other
- character can run forever with [RSHIFT] (for testing)
- highscore and credit screens show how to return to main
- many of the bugs related to collision have been removed

Concerning Coding

*  Previously, many functions unrelated to levels were scattered throughout the
   level_x_state.cpp files in order to accomplish certain goals via quick, sim-
   ple fixes. This seemed very unintuitive, so all enemy-related code was moved
   to enemy.cpp and all character-related code was moved to character.cpp.

*  In addition, due to their similar functionality, all the level files had re-
   petitive uses of the same functions. This was fixed by placing all these re-
   peated functions within playing_state.cpp.

*  We also realized that many of the x_state files were using similar functions
   "privately" rather than sharing them under a "protected" class. This was fi-
   xed by placing these function within state.cpp.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Assets (Derek Chang)
- created all assets and map layout.

Fixed Time-step (Idean)
- Using a fixed timestep now throughout.

Fixed Collision Bugs (Idean)
- Fixed many bugs related to collision resolution. Especially due to rounding
  issues.

Levels (Tae)
~ press [p] to pause the game
~ press [r] to resume the game
~ press [0] to automatically lose
~ press [1] to go to the prev level (!@level1)
~ press [2] to go to the next level (win @level3)
~ at the start of each level: panning scene - shows where the stairs are
  * if you want to skip this scene, press [m]

Fixed Sword Implementation (Tae)
~ it is its own separate sprite
~ cool combo: [space], run right after

Seg Fault Mistakes (Billy)
~ enemies were randomy causing seg faults
~ seg faults now no longer occur when touching a trap

Created new Trap (Billy)
~ spinning blades king must evade
~ health powerup you will get you an extra heart
  ~ and you will regain full health.

Instruction texts(Billy and Tae)
~ when activating trap getting a key or falling down a hole, the game will pause
   and you will get an text saying what happened.

All levels are now subclassed (Billy)
~ fixed many bugs associated with the levels
  * enemies were not acting correctly, faciltate changing up code

Collision Grid/Buckets (Idean)
- Split the map into a grid layout, and collision checks occur within each grid.
- Changed the collision resolution logic to use velocities rather than collision
  rectangles for determining the collision direction. This should fix many bugs
  with collisions that may occur when clipping corners.
- Made enhancements to the update and collisions logic to increase the FPS of
  the game enormously.
- Initial implementation of a fixed time-step (in progress by next week)

Traps (Billy)
1) when a character steps into a room, traps activate
2) the doors close behind him and he cannot escape unless...
3) he kills one of the enemies in the room before they kill him
* During Gameplay, the screen will go "TRAPPED, KILL THEM ALL TO ESCAPE"

Chest and Doors (Billy)
1) walking up to a chest and pressing e will open the chest.
2) item will show up below stamina bar to simulate an inventory.
3) if item is a key, walking up to a door and pressing e will open it.
4) after opening the door, the key is used and disappears.
5) After getting keys a text appears that says the key is to be used on a special door
* when opening a chest, make sure to be  walking towards
  it at the same time

Holes (Billy)
1) walking upon a cracked hole will cause you to fall down a floor
2) your position will be set to a fixed position on level 1

Instructions (Tae Jin Kim)
1) added a new instruction for opening chests
2) made it so pressing buttons before the instructions show up do not cause
   the instructions to be fulfilled

Intro (Tae Jin Kim)
1) fixed the issue where the character can move during the intro
2) edited the location (position & throne) and events of the throne room

King Level (Tae Jin Kim)
1) killing enemies increases your experience
2) you level up once you kill enough enemies
3) it becomes harder to level up as your level increases

Floor Movement (Tae Jin Kim)
Floor 1 to Floor 2    press [2]
Floor 1 to lose       press [3]
Floor 2 to win        press [2]
Floor 2 to lose       press [3]

Other (Tae Jin Kim)
~ edited all of the states so that they utilized maps rather than vectors

Attacking animations. There is a janky change in position occuring when
attacking. To fix this, we are currently splitting the sword sprite from the
character sprite so that the character will stay in the same position on the map
while the sword swings and checks for collisions.

Build Instructions:
  To build the project, run "make"
  To run the application, run "./bin/game"

Character Controls:
  To Move:          [w] 
                 [a][s][d] OR arrow keys
  To Run:         [SHIFT]
  To Attack:      [SPACE]

Other Important Buttons:
  To Quit the Program: [ESCAPE]
  To Return to Menu Screen from any state: [q]

In Title Screen:
  To Skip Scene: [q]

In Intro Screen:
  To Skip Scene: [1]
  To Go to Next Speech: [n]

In Playing State:
  LIVES:
  ~ Start with 3 hearts
  ~ Lose 1/2 heart every time an enemy touches you
  EXTRA:
  ~ Enemies start following you when you get close to them
  ~ There a few seconds of invincibility -> keeps you alive longer
  WINNING:
  ~ Reach the Stairs
  1) From spawn point, move down
  2) You will see open corridors to your right
  3) At the fourth corridor, start walking right
  4) As you walk, you will see a path going down -> stairs
  ~ Highscore is ONLY updated when you win. When you lose, nth happens.

In Menu Screen:
  New Game: Starts Level 0
  HighScores: Shows the highscores
  Credits: Shows who worked on the game
  Quit: Same as pressing [ESCAPE], quits program
  Options can be Chosen with Mouse / arrow keys & [ENTER]/[SPACE]

Notes:
  After running with both valgrind and sanitizers, there are many leaks that
  are coming directly from SDL. All dynamically allocated elements are freed
  all surfaces are freed before reassignment, all textures, audio, the rend-
  erer, and window are all destroyed whenever the application quits, and all
  SDL libraries have been quit when the application panics and when it clos-
  es successfully.
