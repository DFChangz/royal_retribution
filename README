Assignment 3
=====================

Build Instructions:
  Run `make` to build the project.
  
  To run the application, run `./bin/game`

This Game includes 5 enemies that are positioned randomly with random
velocities. The player most avoid the enemies or else there will be a collision
sound if they collide.

Controls:
  Arrow keys or w, a, s, d to move player.
  SHIFT for a boost in speed (temporary for debugging purposes)
  Q to returh to menu at any point.
  Esc to quit immediately at any point.

Notes:
  After running with both valgrind and sanitizers, there are many leaks that
  are coming directly from SDL. All dynamically allocated elements are freed, 
  all surfaces are freed before reassignment, all textures, audio, the renderer,
  and window are all destroyed whenever the application quits, and all SDL
  libraries have been quit whenever the application panics and whenever it
  closes successfully.
